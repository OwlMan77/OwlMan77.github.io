My second project was to show that I could make an app with Mongoose, Express and Node using JWT authentication. What I did with my app was create a Google Map that would show where I have been over the last 3 years. I used a file upload module called Multer which I used along with the JSON data that was obtained using Googleâ€™s Takeout service for the location data on my phone. Finally I used that JSON data to place markers where I had been and used HTML5 geolocation show my current location.
